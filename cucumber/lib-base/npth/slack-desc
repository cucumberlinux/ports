# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.  Line
# up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and the '|'
# on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.  You must
# make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':'.

npth: The NPth package contains a very portable POSIX/ANSI-C based library 
npth: for Unix platforms which provides non-preemptive priority-based 
npth: scheduling for multiple threads of execution (multithreading) inside
npth: event-driven applications. All threads run in the same address space 
npth: of the server application, but each thread has its own individual
npth: program-counter, run-time stack, signal mask and errno variable.
