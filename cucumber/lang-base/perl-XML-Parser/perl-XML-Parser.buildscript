######################## READ BEFORE EDITING THIS FILE #########################
# You probably should not ever need to edit this file. The only time this file #
#  should be edited is when maintaining the buildsystem as a whole. This file  #
#       should NEVER be edited when creating a package; in this case all       #
#         modifications should be made in the .buildinfo file instead.         #

Cucumber Linux Build System Driver for Cucumber Linux .buildinfo Files.
Driver Version: $DRV_VERSION

This is the Cucumber Linux build system driver for .buildinfo files. It sources
the .buildinfo file and uses the variables and functions defined in there to
facilitate building the package.

It also allows for different tasks to be done depending on what the first
argument to the script is. It supports the following arguments:

  * download - Downloads the source tarballs and other source files from the
    upstream provider.
  * verify - Verifies the checksums/signatures of the downloaded source
    tarballs and files.
  * builddeps - Lists the build time dependencies for this package. These are
    defined in the *.buildinfo file by setting the BUILDDEPS to an
    array containing the names of the packages it depends on, as they appear in
    the Cucumber Linux source/ports tree.
  * help - Displays this message.
  * no argument|build - Builds the package, accepting the same variables that
    the original buildscript format did.

This file should be the same for every single package. This allows us to make
global package changes by editing this one file. In other words you should
probably not be editing this file.
